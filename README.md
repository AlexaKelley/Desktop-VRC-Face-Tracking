# Desktop-VRC-Face-Tracking
This is meant as repository for storing my documentation on getting face tracking working in VR Chat on desktop via OSC.

## Current implementation
<rig and setup info here soon> 

## Contributions
I expect to be the sole/primary contributor to this repository. That said I gladly welcome input/feedback/PR's/etc. Please make sure whatever documentation that is submitted has sources appropriately linked/referenced, and preferably with github optimized images. I reserve the right to decline PR's that are off topic, or I otherwise deem not to be a good fit for this repo.
