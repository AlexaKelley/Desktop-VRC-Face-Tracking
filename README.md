# Desktop-VRC-Face-Tracking
This is meant as repository for storing my documentation on getting face tracking working in VR Chat on desktop via OSC. 

## Current implementation
<rig and setup info here soon> 

## Contributions
I expect to be the sole/primary contributor to this repository. That said I gladly welcome input/feedback/PR's/etc. Please make sure whatever documentation that is submitted has sources appropriately linked/referenced, and preferably with github optimized images. I reserve the right to decline PR's that are off topic, or I otherwise deem not to be a good fit for this repo. 

  
### Why are you documenting this?
  In part because this was harder than I think it should be beacuse there were gaps in documentation. Optimally I would like to have submitted PR's/doc updates for fixing that, but many of the projects are closed source or have closed source components. Also I could not find clear contact information for all of them. I do intend on still submitting PRs where I can to remedy, but this will serve as a foundation for that process.
