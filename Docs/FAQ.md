# Why are you doing this on desktop?
Currently I don't have access to VR equipment. I plan to change that in the future, however there are plenty of others who use VR Chat who either can't or won't use headsets/vr equipment who would like the added immersion of being able to interact natively at thier desktop. Also it is my hopes that by recording this it will make things overall more pleasant for people attempting to do this on desktop. 

# Why are you documenting this?
In part because this was harder than I think it should be beacuse there were gaps in documentation. Optimally I would like to have submitted PR's/doc updates for fixing that, but many of the projects are closed source or have closed source components. Also I could not find clear contact information for all of them. I do intend on still submitting PRs where I can to remedy, but this will serve as a foundation for that process.
